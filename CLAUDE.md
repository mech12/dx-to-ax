# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Python project currently in early setup phase.

## Development Commands

### Running Python Scripts
```bash
python hello.py
```

### Running Tests
```bash
python -m pytest                    # Run all tests
python -m pytest path/to/test.py   # Run a specific test file
python -m pytest -k test_name      # Run tests matching pattern
```

## Code Architecture

This project is currently minimal and does not yet have an established architecture. As the codebase grows, this section should be updated to reflect:
- Module organization and responsibilities
- Key design patterns used
- Data flow and control flow patterns
- Integration points between components
